			<img src="images/me.jpg" class="images" alt="Michael Wolfe">

			<p>Hello and thanks for visiging! I started my progarmming career in high school where I learned binary and made a few simple games in C++. Since then I've slowly taught myself more and more about software development. After high school I studied people and got a degree in Psychology.</p>

			<p>After college I started working within a small corporation that bought and sold industrial manufacturing equipment. I was hired on as a sales manager and kept a steady record. Sales was exciting and lucrative, but it wasn't long before I found my way to the source code of our company website and began making small changes to improve the user experience. Before long I took charge of our inventory and advertising databases while maintaining an exemplory sales record.</p>

			<p>It wasn't long before I rediscoverd my passion for programming and decided to take a full stack development course through UNCC. I enjoy every second I spend coding and can't wait to expand my porfolio with exciting and challenging projects!</p>
